**Note: the following code has already been written, so this code is a basic english version of the SlowServoCORE program (#not ChatGPT)**

Function set_position(speed, pos):
    Create delta array with differences between the target positions and current positions of each servo motor
    Create posCompletion list to track which servos have stopped moving and are at their desired positions
    While some servos are still moving:
        For each servo:
            If it needs to move, move it a little bit (determined by the "speed" input)
            If it has reached its target, mark it as done (stored in the posCompletion list)
        Wait a bit before checking again

Function c(port):
    Return current position of servo motor at index port

Function sum(array):
    Add up all the values in the array and return the total
